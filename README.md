# CSS Nuke

This is a CSS reset that aims to unstylize **all** elements.

Apart from setting the default `box-sizing` to `border-box`, it does not attempt to make "sensible" or "opinionated" defaults.

This was created out of frustration as I couldn't find a CSS reset that resets the font family and font size for form inputs/buttons (commonly missed by CSS resets).

Issues and pull requests welcome.
